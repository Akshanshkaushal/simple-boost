# simple-boost - The Lightning Payment Button

A web component button to trigger a WebLN payment request. The easiest and fastest way for your website visitors to send you sats.

Lightning invoices can either be automatically be generates through a LUNRL-pay Lightning Address or the payment can be sent as a keysend payment.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## Build

This sample uses the TypeScript compiler to produce JavaScript that runs in modern browsers.

To build the JavaScript version of your component:

```bash
npm run build
```

To watch files and rebuild when the files are modified, run the following command in a separate shell:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

Both the TypeScript compiler and lit-analyzer are configured to be very strict. You may want to change `tsconfig.json` to make them less strict.

## Dev Server

This project uses [@web/dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web/dev-server) for previewing the project without additional build steps. Web Dev Server handles resolving Node-style "bare" import specifiers, which aren't supported in browsers. It also automatically transpiles JavaScript and adds polyfills to support older browsers. See [modern-web.dev's Web Dev Server documentation](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) for more information.

To run the dev server and open the project in a new browser tab:

```bash
npm run serve
```

There is a development HTML file located at `/dev/index.html` that you can view at http://localhost:8000/dev/index.html. Note that this command will serve your code using Lit's development mode (with more verbose errors). To serve your code against Lit's production mode, use `npm run serve:prod`.

## Docs

Generate the `/docs` website from the `docs-src` sources.

```bash
npm run docs
```

To serve the site locally, run:

```bash
npm run docs:serve
```

The site will usually be served at http://localhost:8000.
